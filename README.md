## Introduction

CO2 emissions are a critical factor in understanding climate change. This project utilizes time series forecasting techniques to analyze historical emissions data and predict future trends. By applying SARIMA, we aim to capture both trend and seasonality in the data.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis contains CO2 emissions data from various energy sources, including coal and natural gas. The data spans several years, providing a comprehensive view of emission trends over time.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing:** 
   - Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
   - Handling missing values and converting data types as necessary.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualizing the data to identify trends and seasonal patterns.
   - Assessing the stationarity of the time series using statistical tests.

3. **Modeling:**
   - Applying Seasonal ARIMA to capture both trend and seasonal components.
   - Performing model diagnostics to ensure the validity of the model assumptions.

4. **Forecasting:**
   - Generating one-step-ahead forecasts using the fitted model.
   - Comparing forecasted values with actual values to assess model accuracy.

## Results

The results show that CO2 emissions from natural gas power generation are expected to continue increasing, while emissions from coal are declining. The model demonstrates a satisfactory fit, allowing for reliable forecasts of future emissions.

## Conclusion

This project provides valuable insights into CO2 emission trends from different energy sources. The use of SARIMA facilitates a better understanding of historical data and aids in predicting future emissions, which is crucial for informing energy policies and sustainability initiatives.
